Important bugfix for aggregating last active times for both talkgroups and callsigns.
<!-- excerpt -->
Shortly after publishing the first public release of my Brandmeister Top Acivity app, I noticed that
there appeared to be an issue where the 'last active' times being shown for talkgroups and callsigns
weren't correct. I added a bunch of test cases to help me narrow down the issue and finally fixed
it.

For more details, see the [official release notes](https://github.com/alexgladd/bm-hotgroups/releases/tag/0.1.1).
