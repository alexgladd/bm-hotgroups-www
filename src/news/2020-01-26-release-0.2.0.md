The filters release! Now you can filter aggregated talkgroups and callsigns.
<!-- excerpt -->
This release adds a handful of filter options to both the list of aggregated talk groups and
callsigns. For talkgroups, you can only show groups that have an associated name and you can filter
the list by name. For callsigns, you can only show users that have an associated callsign and/or
name, and you can filter the list by callsign and/or name.

These filters let you quickly scan the lists to find the talkgroups and callsigns that you're most
interested in.

For more details, see the [official release notes](https://github.com/alexgladd/bm-hotgroups/releases/tag/0.2.0).
