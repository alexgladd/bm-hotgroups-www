Migration to Github Actions for CI/CD.
<!-- excerpt -->
In this release there are no actual changes to the Brandmeister Top Activity app itself. Instead,
this release migrates the app to use Github Actions for continuous integration and continuous
deployment. Previously I was using TravisCI for this, but wanted to change to
[Actions](https://github.com/alexgladd/bm-hotgroups/actions) to keep everything in one place.

At the same time, I'm currently working on some [changes](https://github.com/alexgladd/bm-hotgroups/issues/3)
to show real-time active talkgroups and callsigns in the app, so stay tuned!

Cheers,<br>
~Alex
