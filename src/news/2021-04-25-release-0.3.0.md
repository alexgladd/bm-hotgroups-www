The "current activity" release; see real-time network activity.
<!-- excerpt -->
In this release I added a [feature](https://github.com/alexgladd/bm-hotgroups/issues/3) that lets
you see real-time activity on the Brandmeister network. At a glance, you can see all open sessions
including which callsign is talking to which talkgroup, and for how long. This works well in
combination with the top talkgroups and callsigns aggregations to give you a complete picture of
where there's activity on the network.

I also added a control that allows users to clear all data from the aggregation window. This is
useful if you've stepped away for a minute and want to reset things without disconnecting and
reconnecting to the network.

Finally, this release fixes an [issue](https://github.com/alexgladd/bm-hotgroups/issues/23) where 
the app wasn't reading data from the network properly anymore. This issue was caused by a change to
the underlying Brandmeister network API. They seem to have made some changes to the way their
session events work.

### More updates

This release was quickly followed by version 0.3.1, which includes and update to all of the app's
dependencies and fixes a typo.

### Known issues
I'm seeing some strange behavior with the Brandmeister network API in some cases where it doesn't
seem like sessions are ever closing (they just go on forever). I'll continue to monitor.

Cheers,<br>
