The "v1" release; ready for production!
<!-- excerpt -->
In this release I took care o a couple custodial tasks that I had been meaning to do for a while
before calling the app "version 1". First, I wanted to provide navigation links from the app back
to this site so that users who found the app first can read more about it. I also make the
navigation menu responsive so that it works well on mobile devices. I know a lot of users like to
use the app on their mobile devices. Second, I wanted to take care of a few different cleanup tasks
of the app's site metadata, including a new site icon and a basic sitemap. Finally, I added
integration with [Sentry](https://sentry.io) so I could get notified if there are any uncaught
errors that users encounter in production.

I've updated the screenshots on the [About](https://www.brandmeisteractivity.live) homepage to
reflect the changes above (mainly the addition of the navigation menu). I hope you continue to enjoy
using the app!

Cheers,<br>
